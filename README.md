# TSM-Net

First download the pre-trained model from [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tsmnet-mmasia23/demo/tree/main/weights) and place it under the `weights` directory. Then run
```
python app.py
```
to setup a live demo, or you can try it [online](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tsmnet-mmasia23/demo) first.

See `app.py` for a detailed example of using TSM-Net.

We plan to release the training code in December
